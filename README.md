# 2016 Election Demographics Analysis
A Python project for final coursework in a University of Pennsylvania STAT_177 Data Science in Python course. The project was completed in 2020 and adjusted in 2021 for additional analysis. 

The project involved conducting an examination and analysis of county-level and state-level voting results and determining statistically significant associations with 2016 election results and measurable health, economic, and demographic characteristics of counties.

Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, and others, were utilized to identify relevant predictor variables for county-level election results in the 2016 Presidential Election. The libraries were used to create boxplots, swarmplots, relplots, lmplots, catplots, simple regression analyses, and regression trees. 

Resulting analyses were summarized and conclusions were listed from the findings on statistically significant associations between county characteristics and party voting results. Specifically, percentage of rural area per county and levels of severe housing problems were associated with having the highest importance in predicting voting patterns by county.
